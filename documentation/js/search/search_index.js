module to handle and transform file paths.\nchalk: A library for styling console output, allowing colored messages.\n\nThe findDeprecatedFiles function recursively traverses the specified directory\nand its subdirectories. For each TypeScript (.ts) file found, it reads the file\ncontent to check for the presence of the @deprecated tag. If found, it logs\nthe file name and path in yellow color to indicate it is deprecated.\nThe directory to start the search is defined by joining the current\ndirectory path with 'src'.\nUsage:\n\nThis script can be used as part of a maintenance routine to identify\ndeprecated files within a project, helping developers to keep track of\noutdated code.\n\nExample:\nExample :node path/to/this/script.jsRunning this script will output the paths of all TypeScript files containing\nthe @deprecated tag in the 'src' directory and its subdirectories.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                dir\n                                            \n                                                            string\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    No\n                                            \n\n\n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                            Returns :         void\n\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\nDescription\nNest framework TypeScript starter repository.\nInstallation\nExample :$ yarn installRunning the app\nExample :# development\n$ yarn run start\n\n# watch mode\n$ yarn run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ yarn run start:prodTest\nExample :# unit tests\n$ yarn run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ yarn run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ yarn run test:covSupport\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project.
