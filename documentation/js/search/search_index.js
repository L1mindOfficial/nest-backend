It implements the NestInterceptor interface, allowing it to\nintercept and transform responses before they are sent to the client.\nThe primary responsibility of this interceptor is to append an apiVersion field to every response,\nindicating the version of the API being used. The API version is determined from the request itself,\nand if no version is specified, it defaults to '1'.\nThis interceptor leverages RxJS's map operator to modify the response object by wrapping the original\nresponse data along with the apiVersion, ensuring consistent response formatting across the application.\nIt is typically used in APIs where versioning is important, and response consistency is desired across\nmultiple endpoints.\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        Methods\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                intercept\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n            \n    \n    \n        Methods\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        intercept\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nintercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler)\n                \n            \n\n\n                    \n                        \n                            Defined in src/common/interceptors/data-response/data-response.interceptor.ts:33\n                        \n                    \n\n\n            \n                \n                        The intercept method intercepts the execution context and modifies the response.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                context\n                                            \n                                                        ExecutionContext\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    No\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    \nExecutionContext gives access to the request and its details.\n\n\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                next\n                                            \n                                                        CallHandler\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    No\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    \nCallHandler provides a handle() method to delegate to the next action in the pipeline.\n\n\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                            Returns :     Observable\n\n                        \n                            \n                                Observable that wraps the modified response.\n\n                            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        import {\n  CallHandler,\n  ExecutionContext,\n  Injectable,\n  NestInterceptor\n} from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { map, Observable } from 'rxjs';\n\n/**\n * The DataResponseInterceptor class is a globally applied interceptor that modifies the structure of\n * HTTP responses in a NestJS application.

occur due to policy violations or other reasons.\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n

directory for TypeScript files that contain\nthe @deprecated tag and logs their paths to the console.\nDependencies:\n\nfs: Node.js file system module to interact with the file system.\npath: Node.js module to handle and transform file paths.\nchalk: A library for styling console output, allowing colored messages.\n\nThe findDeprecatedFiles function recursively traverses the specified directory\nand its subdirectories. For each TypeScript (.ts) file found, it reads the file\ncontent to check for the presence of the @deprecated tag. If found, it logs\nthe file name and path in yellow color to indicate it is deprecated.\nThe directory to start the search is defined by joining the current\ndirectory path with 'src'.\nUsage:\n\nThis script can be used as part of a maintenance routine to identify\ndeprecated files within a project, helping developers to keep track of\noutdated code.\n\nExample:\nExample :node path/to/this/script.jsRunning this script will output the paths of all TypeScript files containing\nthe @deprecated tag in the 'src' directory and its subdirectories.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                dir\n                                            \n                                                            string\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    No\n                                            \n\n\n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                            Returns :         void\n\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\nDescription\nNest framework TypeScript starter repository.\nInstallation\nExample :$ yarn installRunning the app\nExample :# development\n$ yarn run start\n\n# watch mode\n$ yarn run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ yarn run start:prodTest\nExample :# unit tests\n$ yarn run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ yarn run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ yarn run test:covSupport\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project.

values that may come from query parameters or form submissions,\nwhere boolean values can be represented as strings (e.g., \"true\", \"false\").\nThe transformation logic is encapsulated in the toBoolean function, which processes the input value:\n\nReturns true for the string \"true\".\nReturns false for the string \"false\".\nReturns 'failure' if the value is null.\nFor any other value, it returns the original value.\n\nThis decorator can be applied to class properties to automatically convert incoming values to booleans.\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n    \n
