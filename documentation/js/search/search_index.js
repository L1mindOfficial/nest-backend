           This module scans a specified directory for TypeScript files that contain\nthe @deprecated tag and logs their paths to the console.\nDependencies:\n\nfs: Node.js file system module to interact with the file system.\npath: Node.js module to handle and transform file paths.\nchalk: A library for styling console output, allowing colored messages.\n\nThe findDeprecatedFiles function recursively traverses the specified directory\nand its subdirectories. For each TypeScript (.ts) file found, it reads the file\ncontent to check for the presence of the @deprecated tag. If found, it logs\nthe file name and path in yellow color to indicate it is deprecated.\nThe directory to start the search is defined by joining the current\ndirectory path with 'src'.\nUsage:\n\nThis script can be used as part of a maintenance routine to identify\ndeprecated files within a project, helping developers to keep track of\noutdated code.\n\nExample:\nExample :node path/to/this/script.jsRunning this script will output the paths of all TypeScript files containing\nthe @deprecated tag in the 'src' directory and its subdirectories.\n\n\n

It enforces a conventional commit message format, ensuring\nthat commit messages are consistent and meaningful.\nThe configuration extends from the conventional commit style and includes a custom\nparser preset and formatter.\nRules:\n\ntype-enum: Specifies the allowed types of commits:\n\nfeat: New feature\nfix: Bug fix\ndocs: Documentation changes\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)\nrefactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature\nperf: Performance improvement\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies\nci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts\nchore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\nrevert: Reverts a previous commit\n\n\nscope-enum: Specifies the allowed scopes for commits, helping to categorize changes:\n\nsetup: Project setup\nconfig: Configuration files\ndeps: Dependency updates\nfeature: Feature-specific changes\nbug: Bug fixes\ndocs: Documentation\nstyle: Code style/formatting\nrefactor: Code refactoring\ntest: Tests\nbuild: Build scripts or configuration\nci: Continuous integration\nrelease: Release related changes\nother: Other changes\n\n\n\nUsage:\nTo use this configuration, ensure that you have Commitlint set up in your project.\nHere’s an example of a valid commit message that would pass this configuration:\n\nfeat(config): add support for new environment variables\nfix(docs): correct typo in installation instructions\nchore(deps): update dependency version\n\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n    findDeprecatedFiles.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        directoryPath\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         string\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : path.join(__dirname, 'src')\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                    Defines the path to the 'src' directory located in the current module's directory.\nThe __dirname variable contains the absolute path to the directory that\ncontains the currently executing script. By using path.join, we create a\ncross-platform compatible path that points to the 'src' subdirectory.\nThis path will be used later in the script to search for TypeScript files\nthat may contain the @deprecated tag.\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n    src/infrastructure/config/env.constants.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        ENV_VALIDATION_SCHEMA\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     unknown\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : Joi.object({\n  /**\n   * The username for the database connection.\n   * This is a required string that should match the database user's login credentials.\n   */\n  DATA_SOURCE_USERNAME: Joi.string().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The password for the database connection.\n   * This is a required string that corresponds to the user's password for the database.\n   */\n  DATA_SOURCE_PASSWORD: Joi.string().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The host address for the database server.\n   * This is required and must be a valid hostname or IP address where the database is hosted.\n   */\n  DATA_SOURCE_HOST: Joi.string().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The port number on which the database server is running.\n   * This is required and must be a valid number representing the port used to connect to the database.\n   */\n  DATA_SOURCE_PORT: Joi.number().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The name of the database to connect to.\n   * This is a required string representing the specific database within the server.\n   */\n  DATA_SOURCE_DATABASE: Joi.string().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The full URL for the database connection.\n   * This is a required string that combines the database credentials and host information into a single connection string.\n   */\n  DATA_SOURCE_URL: Joi.string().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).\n   * This is a required string and must be securely set to ensure the integrity and security of JWT authentication.\n   */\n  JWT_SECRET_KEY: Joi.string().required(),\n\n  /**\n   * The environment in which the application is running.\n   * This is a required string that must be set to either 'development', 'production', or other recognized environments.\n   */\n  NODE_ENV: Joi.string().required()\n})\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                    The ENV_VALIDATION_SCHEMA is a Joi schema used to validate environment variables\nin the application. This ensures that the necessary environment variables are provided and\nmeet the expected data types, preventing the application from starting with invalid or missing configuration.\nEach environment variable is validated with the following rules:\n\nDATA_SOURCE_USERNAME: The username for the database connection (required).\nDATA_SOURCE_PASSWORD: The password for the database connection (required).\nDATA_SOURCE_HOST: The hostname for the database server (required).\nDATA_SOURCE_PORT: The port number for the database server (required, must be a number).\nDATA_SOURCE_DATABASE: The name of the database (required).\nDATA_SOURCE_URL: The full connection URL for the database, typically combining the above credentials (required).\nJWT_SECRET_KEY: The secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (required).\nNODE_ENV: The environment in which the application is running (e.g., 'development', 'production') (required).\n\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n    src/features/auth/decorators/ipAddress.decorator.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        IpAddress\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     unknown\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : createParamDecorator(\n  (data: string, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {\n    const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();\n\n    const ip = request.headers['x-forwarded-for'] as string;\n\n    if (ip && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n      return ip.split(',')[0].replace(',', '');\n    }\n\n    return ip ??

If the IP is not found or the application is\nrunning in development, it defaults to '127.0.0.1'.\nUsage: @IpAddress() can be used in route handlers to get the IP\naddress of the client.\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n    src/core/validators/decorators/is-password.decorator.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        IS_PASSWORD_KEY\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         string\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : 'isPassword'\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                    The IS_PASSWORD_KEY constant is a unique identifier used for the IsPassword validation decorator.\nThis key is essential for the class-validator library to recognize and manage the password validation\nlogic associated with the IsPassword decorator.
